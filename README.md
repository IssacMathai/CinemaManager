# CinemaManager
Cinema Manager is a command line Java application designed to help manage a cinema theatre. You can sell tickets, check available seats and see sales statistics.

To open the application, run Cinema.java which is located in the src folder.

## Features
Cinema Manager offers the following features:

- Ticket Sales: You can sell tickets to customers.

- Seat Availability: You can check the availability of seats in the theatre, allowing you to see which seats are currently occupied and which are available.

- Sales Statistics: The application keeps track of sales data, allowing you to view statistics such as the number of tickets sold, percentage of seats sold and total income.

## Background
Cinema Manager was developed while I was beginning to learn Java in University. I wanted to create a small project outside Uni so that I could do some learning in my own time and gain more practical experience rather than just sitting through lectures about Java. The key takeaways from this experience was learning how to use the scanner class and becoming more comfortable with 2D arrays.

Next time, I would create a GUI using JavaFX rather than being a command line application. This would be more aesthetically pleasing and be more user friendly.
